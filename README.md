## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m Working On

### Master Thesis : Predicting human joint angles of upper ad lower limbs during a variety of ADLs (Activities of Daily Living) like walking, jumping, picking-up a pen, shelve-ordering,...
Highlights :
* Developing deep learning models (LSTM, autoencoders) in Python (Keras) to predict upper and lower limb joint angles from IMU sensor data.
* Processing large-scale real and synthetic IMU and motion capture datasets using NumPy and pandas.
* Evaluating model accuracy with MAE and RMSE against ground truth joint angles.
